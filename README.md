# Multimodal-Audio

At this assignment we will create a model that used for modal speech emotion recognition on YouTube interviews. As first step we crawled videos that contain English dialogs from YouTube. After that, 3 sentiments classifiers used to recognize negative, neutral and positive sentiments. The most confident of these decisions (negative, neutral and positive sentiments) used to train an audio-based emotion recognizer. As next step, this trained audio model will be used to classify other testing videos. At the end we are going to evaluate the model by defining the ground truth. A subset of the audio classifier outcomes, specifically 100 samples of negative, neutral and positive were evaluated by listening them and put a sentiment tag. After these 2 different tags are compared.
